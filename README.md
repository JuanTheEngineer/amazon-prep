# Amazon Preparation
A Repository to document preparation and review for an upcoming Summer 2021 internship.
Netbeans is used as the development environment and the programming language used for the 
first part is Java. Projects include: 
- HelloWorldApp
- ForEachDemo
- LambdaExpressionDemo
- StreamDemo
___
#### HelloWorldApp
This first project was simply used as an exercise to learn the Netbeans environment. 
#### ForEachDemo
A demonstration of the origin of lamdba functions from Anonymous Classes and Functional
interfaces used disposably in code to inplace function definitions. The comments, though a
bit messy, aim to exhibit earlier coding approaches.
#### LambdaExpressionDemo
This demonstration has a similar aim as the previous one but goes a deeper in detail. It
also makes the connection between Lambda Expressions and what they are responsible for in the JAVA collections and stream APIs.

#### StreamDemo
This is the project where most of the exhibition code lives. At the basic level, it provides
OOP demostrations that are used to test Stream and Pipeline functionality.  As far as Java
Stream, it attempts to cover a few of the major methods in the package as well as the
capabilities an engineer has when manipulating the data streams. In the documentation section
of the code is a self-written cheat sheet on major methods in the Stream class. Also, Java
Data and Time API utilization is slipped into the code wherever possible for good measure.
